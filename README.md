# blinkytape-lightshow
Python code to control [blinky tape](http://blinkinlabs.com/blinkytape/). Different lighting effects set static color(sets strip to one color), two color swap(swaps colors back and forth between adjacent pixels), color fade(transitions colors from one color to another), color phase which creates a rainbow effect, multicolor partition which will split up the LED into different colors and travel up which creates a block which colors up the led strip. Another feature of this code is a GPU mode which will color the LEDs based on the GPU temperature when a game is playing. To run the code use the lights.py script which contains the different light functions. This code has been tested on Windows, Mac and Linux, although not all platform specific functions have been completed, work in progress.
